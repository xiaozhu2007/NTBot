## Issue

We have 3 phase tags to try to organize the problem:

- Stage 1: just created by someone new to the project, we don't know yet if it deserves an implementation / a fix
- Stage 2: promising idea, but needs more thinking before implementation
- Stage 3: idea is precisely specified, only coding is left to do
